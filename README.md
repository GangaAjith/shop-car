This is an application which loads the list of available Cars and its details from Cazoo Api.

This is fully implemented in Kotlin language using following design patterns:
1) MVVM clean Architecture
2) Dependency Injection using Kodein
3) Retrofit for network calls (Library Dependency)
4) Glide for image loading (Library Dependency)
5) Coroutine and flow
